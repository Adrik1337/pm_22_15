        <h2>Nezuko Kamado</h2>
            Nezuko Kamado (竈門かまど 禰ね豆ず子こ Kamado Nezuko) is the deuteragonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.
            She is the younger sister of Tanjiro Kamado, one of the two remaining members of the Kamado family, and an informal member of the Demon Slayer Corps.
            Formerly a human, she was attacked and transformed into a demon by Muzan Kibutsuji.
           <h2>Personality</h2> 
        Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl who thought of others before herself, much like her older brother, Tanjiro.
        Additionally, she was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings and often put their needs before her own.
        Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's way, protecting her friends from demons even after being returned to a human state.
        It is also shown that Nezuko's humane, laid-back demeanor supports this fact after Tanjiro apologizes to her.

        While Nezuko initially starts off like any other demon, bloodthirsty and hungry for human flesh, after seeing her brother's desire to protect her from being killed by a Demon Slayer despite her being a demon, she changes completely and becomes fiercely protective of him.
        Nezuko seems to have forgotten a good portion of her memories as a human, besides those related to her family, and thus doesn't retain the exact personality she had before transformation, instead acting akin to a child. She is still very caring and protective towards humans who she sees as members of her family, although this is mainly due to the influence Sakonji Urokodaki had on her while she was asleep for two years.
        Nezuko also retains some of her human emotions, as she has been seen to cry when sad and smile when happy, but in general, she appears more detached than her human cohorts, although she is still much calmer and less malicious than most demons.
        Since becoming a demon, Nezuko appears to have become rather brazen and does not seem to fear fighting; she fiercely guards her brother as well as her allies.
        She has also developed a strong willpower, which can be seen through her refusal to consume human flesh or blood, even in cases of extreme injury or exposure to human blood, which can be seen when she refuses Sanemi Shinazugawa after he attempts to lure her into biting him with his Marechi blood.
        Her strong willpower remains even when she is no longer a demon, as shown when she willingly leaps in front of Inosuke to protect him from her own brother, who had become a demon and was attempting to kill those around him.
        Though she could have been killed, Nezuko did not hesitate to protect her brother.
        On the rare occasion that Nezuko attempts speech, she has been seen to stutter a lot, which may be due to her bamboo mouthpiece, which is seldom removed, and the fact that she didn't speak for a number of years after her transformation.
        However, after developing resistance towards sunlight, which allows her to go outside and interact with others more often, her speech has shown signs of improvement, and she is able to fully pronounce words if someone else has just spoken them, or hears them repeated frequently enough.
        Nezuko has the subconscious memory of Muzan callously slaughtering her family and harbors a deep anger and resentment towards demons.
        Due to Sakonji Urokodaki hypnotizing her while she slept for two years, this anger manifests into protectiveness and determination when she witnesses demons harming innocent humans in which she pictures the images of her family.
        However, this can also apply to friendly demons as shown when she sees her youngest brother Rokuta in Yushiro, a cantankerous but good-hearted demon.
        Interestingly, when she first fully awakens her demonic powers when fighting Daki in Yoshiwara, Nezuko revealed a side to her that was severely uncharacteristic of her usual benevolence.
        Although she was at first fueled by the same vengeance against demons, especially since Daki had almost killed Tanjiro, as an awakened demon herself, her rage grew beyond being justified at being a victim of their cruelty.
        Witnessing Daki struggle in agony, Nezuko tortured the demon in a manner typical of the species' sadism towards humans, demonstrated by her wicked grin and laughter as she brutalized her opponent.
        Nezuko had also regressed back to her feral demonic state; when she saw a woman with an open bleeding wound, she instantly became tantalized and attempted to attack her.
        Fortunately, Tanjiro intervened and brought Nezuko back to her normal self by singing a lullaby their late mother sung, filling Nezuko with enough shame and grief for her to regain control of her impulses.
        Eventually, during the battle against Hantengu, Nezuko was able to control herself in this form, enabling her to fight with a stable mind and her superior strength together. 
        It was later revealed by Tamayo that her missing memories and underdeveloped personality were due to her not being fully conscious, as she prioritized developing her resistance to the sun over regaining her consciousness.
